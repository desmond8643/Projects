Pac-man
It is a game created in Scratch, it is an assignment from CS50 week 0. 
This game is inspired by pac-man, I changed up the rule of the game by making it a time trial, win the game by letting pac-man eat all the dots in the field, and you can try to beat your own record.
Controls: up, down, left, right
